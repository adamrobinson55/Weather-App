# Weather-App

## Description
I made this app because most weather apps have an egrgious ammount of ads. I made this project so I could have a weather app without ads.
In making this project I used very little CSS and HTML and focused mainly on using JavaScript to create everything in the app. One of the
most challenging parts of this was adding the weather symbols.

## Usage
Type the name of the city you'd like to see the 5 day report for and press Search. It will load a list of cities you've searched from 
localstorage, you can click on those and see the 5 day weather report for cities you searched before
